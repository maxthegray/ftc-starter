/**
 * Runtime drive tuning knobs.
 *
 * Physical constants (mass, forward/lateral zero-power acceleration, motor
 * names, Pinpoint pod offsets, etc.) live in
 * [org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.pedroPathing.Constants] — that is the file
 * Pedro reads when it builds the Follower. DriveConfig holds the other
 * things: driver feel, teleop scaling, and default brake behavior.
 *
 * These are `var`s so Panels can mutate them live during tuning sessions.
 *
 * [Pinned] so Sloth loads this object exactly once and never re-runs its
 * static initialiser on hot reload. Without it, every reload would reset
 * these fields to the defaults below and wipe whatever Panels tuned live.
 * Trade-off: edits to *this file* need a full install, not a hot reload.
